**sense-export** is a tiny and sweet visualization extension allowing you to **export data without showing the underlying table**. 

### Why?
Every object in Qlik Sense provides the export functionality, but sometimes one just wants to provide a download of some data from your data model by putting a tiny little button onto a screen, completely without showing the data first.

### Screenshots

Just a very simple button with some properties to define the layout and the behavior of the export.
See **Configuration** for mor details.
