## Purpose and Description

**_sense-export_** is a tiny and sweet visualization extension allowing you to **export data without showing the underlaying table**.

**Why?**

Every object in Qlik Sense provides the export functionality, but sometimes one just wants to provide a download of some data from your data model by putting a tiny little button onto a screen, completely without showing the data first

## Screenshots

## Installation & Download

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-export/raw/master/build/sense-export_latest.zip) or [any other version](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-export/tree/master/build) you want to install.
2. Then install on either _Qlik Sense Desktop_ or _Qlik Sense Server_:

* Qlik Sense Desktop
  - To install, unzip all files and copy the content to the folder folder `"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions\sense-navigation"`
* Qlik Sense Server
  - See instructions [how to import an extension on Qlik Sense Server](http://help.qlik.com/sense/2.0/en-US/online/#../Subsystems/ManagementConsole/Content/import-extensions.htm)

## Configuration

## Compatibility

**_sense-export_** is designed to work with Qlik Sense 2.1.1 or higher.
If you use the visualization extension in an older version of Qlik Sense the following message will be shown:

## Known Issues

There are two known issues which will be addressed in future versions:

* Vertical alignment of the button is currently now possible.
* Improvement for the mobile view, reserve less space for the export button.
